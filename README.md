# brainfuck_uP

A brainfuck-native soft processor written in Verilog.

The only project included at the moment is the one used for the ***Brainfuino [-]+.*** board. It's implemented in a Lattice Diamond project for a MachXO2 FPGA (LCMXO2-640HC-4TG100C). 

## Source Code

The source code is in the [source folder](./Brainfuino/brainfuck_uP/source/).
